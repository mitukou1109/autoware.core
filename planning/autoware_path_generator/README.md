# Path Generator

The `path_generator` node receives a route from `mission_planner` and converts the center line into a path.
If the route has waypoints set, it generates a path passing through them.

This package is a simple alternative of `behavior_path_generator`.

## Path generation

When input data is ready, it first searches for the lanelet closest to the vehicle.
If found, it gets the lanelets within a distance of `backward_path_length` behind and `forward_path_length` in front.
Their center lines are concatenated to generate a path.

If waypoints exist in the route, it replaces the overlapped segment of the center line with them.
The overlap interval is determined as shown in the following figure.

![waypoint_group_overlap_interval_determination](./media/waypoint_group_overlap_interval_determination.drawio.svg)
